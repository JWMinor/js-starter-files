Useful code from today's workshop:

alert("hello");        --> creates a pop-up that says "hello"
console.log("hello");  --> prints a message to the console ("hello")

var myName = "Emily";  --> String variable
var myArms = 2;        --> Number variable

console.log(myName)    --> will print the VALUE of the VARIABLE myName

var myLegs = 2;        --> Number variable again
var myLimbs;		   --> an undefined variable... to be defined later!

myLimbs = myArms + myLegs;  --> A basic operator (addition)

console.log(myLimbs);  --> will print the value of myLimbs (4)
